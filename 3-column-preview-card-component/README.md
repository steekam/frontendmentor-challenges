## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me learn how to use flexbox to create containers/cards of the same height regardless of their content. I was also able to use CSS custom properties.



### Continued development

I want to do more challenges that involve layout decisions to use either CSS Grid or FlexBox. I also want to learn how to style box-shadows on components. I want more challenges to help me practise the CSS building blocks.
